# Java resources.

## Disclaimer
The Java world is a very rich and complex environment. So one might regularly refer to resources, documentation and tutorials in order to efficiently solve day to day problems.
 
Furthermore, Java is a living language that constantly evolves. A developer should then always keep learning and experimenting with latest trends and API. 

So I have listed hereafter the best resources I have found on the internet.
This list is firstly for me to efficiently find information on a specific Java issue, being able to reach trusted sources quickly, but, as a big open-source fan and as these information are anyway freely available, I see no point in not letting it freely available.

As usual, I will took no responsibility of any kind about using the below information, that might sometimes be false or deprecated. (You should contact me or send a pull request if you see errors or have interesting additional resources to suggest).
