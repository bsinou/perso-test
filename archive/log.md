# History log for my personal #100DaysOfCode challenge.

## Disclaimer
The content of the file and generally of the full repository is an open slate where I record my steps while taking a break in my professional life as a developer to get an overview of the state of the art nowadays technologies and trend before starting new projects.

While following the #100DaysOfCode trend is kind of motivating and challenging, it is not the main and only goal and rather a help to get motivated. Hence I might not respect all the official rules, especially the "at least one hour everyday" because of other things I have to do, mainly taking care of myself and my family and doing short-term contracts.
